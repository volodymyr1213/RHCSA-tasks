25. Bind to the LDAP domain ‘dc=example,dc=com’ provided by classroom.example.com for user
authentication. Note the following:
- ldapuser7 should be able to log into your system, where 7 is your station number, but will not have a home
directory until you have completed the autofs requirement below.
- ldapuser7 have a password of “redhat”
- you will get your CA certificate at http://classroom.example.com/pub/example-ca-crt.


26. Configure autofs to automount the home directories of LDAP users. Note the following:
- 172.24.8.x-nfs-exports /home/ to your system where x is your station number.
- ldapuser7 home directory is 172.25.254.254/home/rusers.
- ldapuser7 home directory should be automated local beneath /home as /home/rusers/ldapuser7.
- home directories must be writable by their users.
- while you are able to log in as any of the users ldapuser1 through ldapuser20, the only home directory is
